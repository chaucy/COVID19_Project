Google Analytics Capstone Project using COVID-19 data from 2020 to 2023 JAN.

This Case Study was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

1. Objective (Ask Phase)

To analyze the impact of COVID-19 on different countries, including the effects on wealth, health conditions, and government restrictions.

2. Prepare Phase

The data was obtained from the Our World in Data website (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). It was organized by country and date, and was assumed to be credible since it was compiled by University of Oxford (Oxford Martin School).

3. Process Phase

The data was cleaned and organized in a structured manner using T-SQL scripts. Any missing or inconsistent data was handled and marked for exclusion from the Tableau visualization graph. A full description of the data processing is described in the SQL code files.

4. Analyze Phase

In this phase, queries were created to uncover trends and relationships in the data, such as the relationship between wealth and death rate, the impact of underlying health conditions on COVID-19, and the relationship between government restrictions and the spread of the virus. The results were then visualized in tables and charts to aid in understanding the findings.

5. Share Phase

Visualisations were created using Tableau.
