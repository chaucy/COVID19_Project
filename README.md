Google Analytics Capstone Project: COVID-19 Data (2020-2023 JAN)

1. Objective

The objective of this project was to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on different countries with a focus on the effects on wealth, health conditions, and government restrictions.

2. Data Preparation

The data for this project was sourced from the Our World in Data website (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) and was organized by country and date. The data was assumed to be credible as it was compiled by the University of Oxford (Oxford Martin School).

3. Data Processing

The data was cleaned and organized using T-SQL scripts. Missing or inconsistent data was marked for exclusion from the Tableau visualization graph. A full description of the data processing can be found in the SQL code files.

4. Data Analysis

Queries were created to uncover trends and relationships in the data, including the relationship between wealth and death rate, the impact of underlying health conditions on COVID-19, and the relationship between government restrictions and the spread of the virus. The results were then visualized using tables and charts to aid in understanding the findings.

5. Visualization and Publication

The findings were visualized using Tableau and published at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ccystats/viz/COVID19projectPublic/WorldAVGFatalityrate_1. All visualizations were included in a Google Slides presentation.

6. Sharing of Results

The Google Slides presentation can be accessed at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15akLI-eSxc7_K1GsMrq2KU-3gF42QSZJ2M5z3vUMuE0/edit?usp=sharing.
